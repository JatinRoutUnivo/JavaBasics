What is Inheritance
----------------------------------------------
Inheritance in java is a concept in which one class acquired all the attributes(property) and methods of a parent class.
(means inheritance me ek class apne parent class ki property and methods ko inhert kr leta hai. means ki parent class k attribute and methods ko apni class me use kar sakta hai.)
 Parent class ki property and method ko inhert karne k liye "extends" keyword use hota hai.
 
 syntax:-0
 ----------------------
 class childclass-name extends Parentclass-name{
 //metnhods and fields
 }
 
 * Parent class ko hum Super class or Base class bhi kehte hai.
 * Jo class inhert kar rahe hoti hai usko child class kehte hai. Child class ko hum Subclass bhi kehnte hai or derived class bhi kehte hai.
 * Jis class ko inhert karte hai use Parent class/Super class/Base class bhi kehte hai.
 
 Types of inheritance:-
 ---------------------------
 There are 5 types of inheritance
 1. Single level inheritance:- Extend keyword used. Class B extend the attribute and methods of Parent class A.
 ----------------------------
 Class A
 extends
 Class B
 
 2. Multi level inheritance:- Extend keyword used. Class C extend the attribute and methods of parent class B. and Class B extend the attribute and method of parent class A. So class C has its own property and methods as well as class b and class A property and methhod. Same class B has its own property as well as the prop[erty and class A
 -----------------------
 Class A
 extends
 ClassB
 extends
 Class C
 
 3. Hierarchical inheritance:-Extend keyword used.:-Class A is a Parent class and have two child class. Class B & Class C. Both class B and class C has the property and methods of class A as both extends Class A.
 ------------------------------
             Class A
     extends          extends
  Class B                Class C
 
 
 4. Multiple inheritance:- Interface use
 5. Hybrid inheritance:- Interface use
