Polymorphism
--------------------
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 
Real life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee.
It enables a single action to behave differently based on the object or context it's working with, enhancing flexibility and reusability in code.

Method overloading
------------------------
With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters number and different parameter data types.

example:-
int myMethod(int x)
float myMethod(float x)
double myMethod(double x, double y)

Advantages of method overloading
-----------------------------------------
save memory
increase the readability of the program.

Different ways to overload the method.
---------------------------------------------
There are two ways to overload the method.
By changing number of parameters
By changing the datatype 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constructor overloading
--------------------------------------------
same like method overloading. multiple constructor can have
	 * same name
	 * different parameter number
	 * different parameter data type
	 
	 
Main method overloading
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we can overload main method
application entry point will be 
public static void main(String[] args){
}	 

application execute to main method se he hoga chahea main method k name se kitne bhi method banao.
